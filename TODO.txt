Wed 11/3:
1. Pytorch tutorial
2. What data parameters to use to insert in the regression model; e.g. injuries, player form, opponent form, advanced stats, etc.
4. Organize data into a table, for points for example, use the same number of parameters every time? 
  One column = opponent team, row column = ppg in the past vs team
5. Regression model to make predictions


Soon-ish preferrably:
Understand NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Sci-kit learn libraries
