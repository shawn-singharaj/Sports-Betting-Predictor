TODO November:
1. Automatically use api to add data to json or database
2. Variables to put into logical regression model:
  - Opponent name
  - PPG Last 5 games
  - FG% last 5 games
  - TS% & eFG% last 5 games
  - USG% last 5 games
  - PER last 5 games
  - Opponent Defensive Rating season
  - PPG vs opponent historically
  - Situational Home/Away, Back to Back, Injuries/Minutes 
  - Vegas projections & if player went over or under = label

TABLE:
Row, Label
Column: all other vars, but not game and opponent
x = vars in 2. 
y = label output

3. What model to use?

Soon-ish preferrably:
Understand NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Sci-kit learn libraries
